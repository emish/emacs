These are my notes on various emacs stuff. 

To change settings associated with a certain plugin (group), use: 

M-x customize-group RET <name-of-group>

Popular groups are: ecb, emacs, cedet, semantic

--
CEDET Stuff: 
 - Doesn't seem to work with anything other than: ELISP, C/C++, Java so far. 
   http://cedet.sourceforge.net/languagesupport.shtml
 - In essence, useless for Python, hence the Python section below. 

-- 
ECB Stuff: 
 - Primary mouse is default to "Middle", this can be changed through customize ecb tree
 - Can add new source tree from the customize-group frame
 - Since ECB is not pre-configured to handle git, I am turning off Version Control(VC)
   support.

Python Stuff: 
 - Pymacs: lets you use python in elisp and vice versa
 - Rope and Ropemacs: General refactoring for Python as well as 
   python lib and doc support. Should work nicely with ECB. 
 - YASnippet: Seems to be the dominant templating for Python. 
 - Auto Complete Mode using Ropemacs as a backend. 
 - Code checking on the fly with Flymake/PyFlakes. Also Pylint but not yet
   installed. 
 - Django support with: django-html-mumamo-mode provides syntax highlighting,
   indentation of template tags, and nXhtml benefits for Django templates.
   Also available is Pony mode that enables useful django 
   shell commands in emacs. Not installed yet. 
   Recent django-mode and django-html-mode auto-generates views from urls, 
   but is too auto-ish and restrictive right now. Not installed yet. 

Important python.el mode stuff: 
python-shift-left, C-c C-<
Decrease indentation of the region
python-shift-right, C-c C-<
Increase indentation of the region
python-switch-to-python, C-c C-z
Start (or switch) to a Python shell
python-send-buffer, C-c C-c
Run the current buffer in the Python interpreter
python-send-region, C-c C-r
Run the selected code in the Python interpreter
python-describe-symbol, C-c C-f
Get help on a Python symbol


-- 
Haskell Stuff: 
 - The haskell-mode and haskell-inferior-mode do a good job of summing up
   general intellisence features. Just need to remember the shortcuts.
